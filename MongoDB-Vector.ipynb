The friendly relations between the British Government and Shah Shuja came into existence about the year 1809 A. D., when a Treaty was concluded between them through the efforts of the British ambassadore Mr. Elphinstone Monstuart. Again those relations were strengthened by another Treaty in 1838 between the British Government, Shah Shuja and Maharaja Ranjit Singh. After the murder of Shah Shuja by rebels in Kabul, Prince Taimur, the eldest son and heir-apparent, was brought, among other Princes, to Ludhiana by the British Government and made to settle there with a discriminating political allowance. The said Prince was held in great esteem by the Government. A letter from the Agent to the Governor-General, still in the possession of the family shows that the position of Prince Taimur Shah, as the eldest son of Shah Shuja, was duly recognised in proper quarters and he was relied upon as a faithful custodian of the friendly relations of the family with the British Government. The eldest son of Prince Taimur Shah, Shahzada Sultan Sikandar, Provincial Durbari and Political Pensioner, rendered meritorious services during the Mutiny of 1857 in recognition of which an addition of Rs. 100 p. m. to his pension and a Khillat worth Rs. 2,000 were awarded by H. E. the Governor-General. Shahzada Sultan Sikandar's eldest son, Shahzada Mohammad Tahir, Provincial Durbari and Political Pensioner, served the Government during the Great War with men and money. He also offered his personal services and consequently was made Special Recruiting Officer by virtue of a Special Recruiter's Certificate. Major D. Macaulay, 1st Lancers, Peshawar, who visited Ludhiana in 1916 for recruitment, was deeply impressed by \"his zeal and devotion to support the Government with every available resource at his command.\" He recorded a very high opinion of Shahzada Sultan Ali Sadozai, Ludhiana. his personality. Shahzada Sultan Ali, son of Shahzada Mohammad Tahir, has himself never missed any occasion to offer his services. During the Civil Disobedience movement he rendered valuable services. He is a Political Pensioner and a Divisional Durbari and is a much-respected member of Ludhiana gentry. His son, Shahzada Sultan Ahmad, B.A., LL.B., is a Pleader at Ludhiana. During his academic career he won the esteem of his teaching staff who highly admired his talents and capacities. He is a young man of promise.\n",
