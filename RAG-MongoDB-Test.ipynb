The Rathors were originally known as Rashtrakutas or Rashtras, subsequently, is found by general use, crystallising into Rathors. The earliest mention of them within historical period of in the edicts of Asoka as rulers of the Deccan in the sixth century A. D. On the breaking up the Deccan Kingdom towards the end of the tenth century A. D., they established themselves in Central India with Kanauj as their capital. On the fall of this kingdom at the hands of Shahab-ud-Din Ghouri in 1194 A.D. the descendants of its last Ruler, Maharaja Jey Chand, migrated to Western Rajputana and in course of time founded the principality of Marwar. It was Rao Jodhaji who, in 1459, founded the City of Jodhpur, the present historic and beautiful capital of the State. Amongst the Rajput clans in Rajputana the Rathors, of whom the Ruler of Jodhpur is the recognised head, hold the first place in numerical strength and the area of country held. Bikaner, Kishengarh, Idar, Rutlam, Sailana, Sitamau and Jhabua are the younger branches of the Jodhpur family. The following States are connected by marriage with the Jodhpur House :-Udaipur, Jaipur, Jaisalmer, Rewa, Bundi, Sirohi, Narsingarh, Jamnagar and Bhuj. Jodhpur has played a conspicuous part in history. Rao Maldeo, a contemporary of Shershah and Humayun, had extended his dominions by force of arms as far as Agra and Delhi. Jodhpur's War of Independence against Aurangzeb under Durga Das Rathor has no parallel in history except in that of Mewar against Akbar under Maharana Pratap Singh. Maharaja Jaswant Singh (1638-78), 9th in descent from Jodhaji, founder of the City of Jodhpur, was the first Ruler of Marwar to hold the title of Maharaja. It was Maharaja Man Singh, 6th in descent from Maharaja Jaswant Singh, who entered into a treaty with the British Government in 1818. His adopted son and successor, Maharaja Takht Singh, leased to the British Government the Jodhpur portion of the Sambhar Lake. Maharaja Takht Singh's grandson, Maharaja Sardar Singh, father of the present Ruler, helped the British Government with his Imperial Service Lancers and in various other ways in the North-West Frontier Campaigns of 1897-98 and the China Expedition of 1901. On his death in 1911 he was succeeded by his eldest son, Maharaja Sir Sumer Singh, K.B.E., then a boy of thirteen. He served in France with his Imperial Service Cavalry during the Great War. The traditional bravery of the Rathors was strikingly illustrated in the military achievements of the Jodhpur Cavalry, both in France and Palestine. The Sardar Rissala was the recipient of no fewer than 88 awards from the Government of India to its officers and other ranks for distinguished services in the field. For his War services Maharaja Sumer Singh was made Honorary Lieutenant in the British Army and promoted to the brother, the present Ruler. honorary rank of Major. On his sad death in 1918 at the age of twenty he was succeeded by his younger Colonel His Highness Raj Rajeshwar Saramad-i-Raja-i-Hind Maharaja Dhiraja Sir Umaid Singhji Sahib Bahadur, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., K.C.V.O., A.D.C., was born on the 8th July 1903, and educated at the Mayo College, Ajmer.

The administrative machinery of the Agriculture Department has been overhauled together with Settlement revision and the collection of rents and disposal of lands placed on a better footing. For improving water supply in villages liberal grants are made by Government every year as also loans to cultivators for sinking irrigation wells. Much has been done to improve the Excise Department, the Excise laws and rules having been thoroughly revised. The State has considerable mineral resources like salt, gypsum, Fuller's earth, wolfram, building stone of various colours, and marble from the famous Makrana quarries. The Mines and Industries Department, which is being rapidly modernised, is also encouraging various local industries. There are steadily increasing grants for the development of schemes of social service consistently with the improved standards of present-day living. The Medical Department is growing rapidly. The Windham Hospital, costing about Rs. 17 lakhs, is a model in its line. Zenana Hospital arrangements are equally progressive. The construction of a new Women's Hospital at a cost of about Rs. 12 lakhs is in progress. There are now 28 well-equipped Dispensaries in the Districts and the Government is committed to a policy of building one new dispensary each year. The progress of education is remarkable. The number of educational institutions has increased from 54 to 161 including a notable rise in the number of girls' schools. The annual budget allotment for education has risen from Rs. 75,000 to Rs. 7 lakhs. The Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Movements have also received considerable impetus. The growth of civic sense is being inculcated by an increasing number of Municipalities. The Dharampura Department, dealing with State charities, maintains an Ashram for children and the destitute. The Archological Department, with a Museum and an excellent Library for the public, is actively engaged in the preservation of ancient monuments. The first Railway line in the Jodhpur State was constructed in 1882, and the total mileage at present is about 800 miles, which has cost the State a little over 412 crores of rupees. The Jodhpur Railway Administration also works the Hyderabad Section of 288 miles belonging to the British Government. The Railway brings in a net profit of about Rs. 37 lakhs a year, which amounts to nearly 9% on capital outlay. The Public Works Department is markedly active. The expenditure during 1935 amounted to 31 lakhs of rupees against 6 lakhs 25 years ago. In addition to stately buildings of public utility like the Windham Hospital, Darbar High School, Jaswant College, Rajput Schools, Sardar Market, Clock Tower, State Hotel and the Marble Cenotaph, it has constructed 276 miles of metalled roads and 837 miles of dressed up motorable tracks; also 18 irrigation tanks irrigating 60,000 bighas of land. To meet the increasing needs of the City a new reservoir, Umedsagar, was recently constructed. His Highness personally contributed Rs. 2 lakhs towards its cost. The famous Jodhpur Aerodrome is supplemented by 17 other aeroplane landing grounds in the State. The newly formed Development Department has been showing much progress in town-planning and improvements. The Electrical Department also has developed correspondingly with the general progress of the State, The Army too has been reorganised in thorough conformity with the new order of things. In short, under its present Ruler, Jodhpur can well claim the distinction of being one of the happiest States in India in regard to all-round progress and prosperity. The Royal Silver Jubilee in May, 1935, was befittingly celebrated in the State under the personal guidance of His Highness and the State officials. The total amount collected in the State towards the Silver Jubilee Fund was about Rs. 21 lakhs, which was the highest figure in Rajputana. The death of His Imperial Majesty the King-Emperor George V in January, 1936, was deeply mourned all over the State. 25\n",
